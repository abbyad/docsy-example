  Assigning fine grained settings for user roles
---

Roles are broad general collections of permissions. Permissions are fine grained settings that individually toggle on or off to allow a role to do a certain action or see a certain thing.

Viewing permissions determine which page tabs a user sees in the app and which types of data they do and donâ€™t have access to. User action permissions include who can create (e.g., create new users), who can delete (e.g., delete reports), who can edit (e.g., edit profiles), and who can export (e.g., export server logs).

## Defining User Permissions

Each user role must be given explicit access for each of the following permissions in the app settings.
