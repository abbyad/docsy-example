  Instructions and schema for defining forms

The Reports tab shows all reports, which are completed and submitted forms. App forms are those that can be completed within the app (eg as a completed task, or an action on a contact's profile or reports tab), and are defined as XForms. Reports coming from other channels (via SMS or interoperability with other tools) are defined as JSON forms.
